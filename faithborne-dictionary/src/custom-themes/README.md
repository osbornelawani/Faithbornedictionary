# Custom Themes for Faithborne Dictionary

This directory contains information on how to use and implement custom themes in the Faithborne Dictionary application.

## Adding Custom Themes

To add a new custom theme, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Images**: Ensure that your theme images are in a web-friendly format (e.g., JPG, PNG) and are appropriately sized for the application.

2. **Upload Images**: Place your custom theme images in a designated folder within the `src/custom-themes` directory or any other preferred location in your project.

3. **Modify the Application**: Update the JavaScript code in `faithbornedictionary.html` to include a function that allows users to select and apply the custom theme images. This may involve using the `FileReader` API to read the image files and set them as the background.

4. **Apply the Theme**: Implement a mechanism (e.g., a dropdown or button) in the application that lets users choose from the available custom themes. When a theme is selected, update the application's styles accordingly.

## Example Usage

Here is a simple example of how to apply a custom theme:

```javascript
function setCustomTheme(imageUrl) {
    document.body.style.backgroundImage = `url('${imageUrl}')`;
}
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the custom themes are visually appealing and enhance the user experience.
- Test the themes across different devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.

By following these guidelines, you can easily enhance the Faithborne Dictionary application with custom themes that reflect your personal style or branding.
